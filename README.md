# GPT-book-review
This is a small experiment to take in a txt file and ChatGPT to give back result in html webpage

The idea behind this project is to have a text (a book's text) in txt format to be acted upon by ChatGPT that is seperate from the prompt
The response from ChatGPT is taken in HTML format that can be displayed as a website in any browser in a neat and clean manner.

Notes:
- The prompt is written within the code and can be modified by editting the .py file
- The text to be analysed should be in the same folder and with the name inserthere.txt (can be changed in the code)
- The result will be created in form of a .html file in the same folder
